This program builds a few layers on top of an xception model using
pre-trained weights from imagenet. It then uses this model to train a
bit on a MNIST-compatable dataset. Putting anything in the third
argument spot will enable printing of debug stuff.

Usage:
    python3 mnist-transfer-learning.py sliceNumber epochs

sliceNumber is the max number of pictures to load from mnist.
epochs is the epochs of the training

Examples:
    python3 mnist-transfer-learning.py 200 2
    python3 mnist-transfer-learning.py 2000 100
    python3 mnist-transfer-learning.py 60000 50
    python3 mnist-transfer-learning.py 60000 50 anything
    python3 mnist-transfer-learning.py 60000 50 printplease
    python3 mnist-transfer-learning.py 60000 50 42
